# Profile Page Implementation

## Overview
The social network application now includes comprehensive profile functionality with navigation between users' profiles and the main news feed.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Pages
- **Own Profile (`/profile`)**: Shows current user's profile with edit capabilities
- **Other Users' Profiles (`/user/{userId}`)**: Shows other users' profiles with follow/message options

### 2. Navigation System
- **Header Navigation**: Profile icon to access own profile, home icon for news feed
- **Post/Comment Navigation**: Click any user's name to visit their profile
- **Seamless Routing**: Client-side navigation without page refreshes

### 3. Profile Components

#### AppContent.tsx
- Manages overall application routing
- Handles navigation between login, register, newsfeed, and profile pages
- Supports both own profile and other users' profiles

#### Profile.jsx
- Displays user information (name, username, bio, join date)
- Shows cover photo and profile picture sections
- Lists all user's posts with full interaction capabilities
- Different action buttons for own vs other users:
  - **Own Profile**: Edit Profile button
  - **Other Users**: Follow and Message buttons

#### Header.jsx
- Profile icon navigates to own profile
- Home icon returns to news feed
- Logout functionality

#### Post.jsx & Comment.jsx
- Clickable author names with visual styling
- Navigation to user profiles on name click
- Maintains all existing functionality (likes, comments)

### 4. Visual Design
- **Clickable Names**: Styled with modern blue (#1877f2)
- **Hover Effects**: Color changes and underlines on hover
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Modern Social UI**: Consistent with modern social media design language

### 5. Data Integration
- Fetches user profile data from backend API
- Loads user-specific posts
- Maintains authentication state
- Error handling for missing users or network issues

## Technical Implementation

### Component Hierarchy
```
AppContent.tsx
├── Header.jsx (with navigation props)
├── NewsFeed.jsx (with profile navigation)
│   ├── PostCreator.jsx
│   └── Post.jsx (with navigation props)
│       └── Comment.jsx (with navigation props)
└── Profile.jsx (with navigation props)
    └── Post.jsx (reused for user posts)
```

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks on a name in a post or comment
2. `onNavigateToProfile('user-profile', userId)` is called
3. AppContent updates state to show the user's profile
4. Profile component fetches and displays user data
5. Users can navigate back via header or continue browsing

### API Integration
- `usersAPI.getProfile(userId)` - Fetch user profile data
- `usersAPI.getUserPosts(userId)` - Fetch user's posts
- Existing post/comment APIs work with profile posts

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Your Own Profile
1. Click the profile icon in the header
2. View and edit your profile information
3. See all your posts and interactions

### Viewing Another User's Profile
1. Click on any user's name in a post or comment
2. View their profile information and posts
3. Follow them or send a message (UI ready)

### Navigation Back to Feed
1. Click the home icon in the header
2. Return to the main news feed
3. Continue browsing all posts
